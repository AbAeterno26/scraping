## Introduction
These programs were created for a course in my minor in programming. The goal was to demonstrate the usage of the libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, and argparse. The programs show how to plot bar and line plots by reading a CSV file. The contents of the CSV file are scraped from the web with BeautifulSoup.

## Requirements
None.

## Usage
To start off, simply download the scraping repository and run the command in the terminal on top5_answers.csv and name the output file whatever you want.
